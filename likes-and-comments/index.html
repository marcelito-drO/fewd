        <h1>The Challenges of Programming</h1>

        <p>
          Programming can be tough...
          But when you keep trying
          and trying
          and reading, asking questions, taking coffee breaks, and bathroom breaks
          you unleash your mind
          to learn something
          something worth it
          something fullfiling
          that uplifts your spirit
          and gets you ready
          to get your script working
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Pikachu</li>
          <li>Raichu</li>
          <li>Snorlax</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          There was once a pokemon called Ed. He was a nice pokemon, everyone liked him. One day, Ed realized that he was a very different pokemon from everyone else, he had a long tail that could talk, and a third eye that could see the inner feelings of other pokemons. So Ed decided to leave Pewter City, and become a master pokemon, to one day teach others his powers.

      // Append child to div
